# Design Rules — Ultra-Premium Web Design System

> Attach this file to every prompt. These rules are non-negotiable.
> The goal is to produce websites that look like they were designed by a world-class design studio — not generated by AI.

## 1. CORE PHILOSOPHY

Every design decision must be **intentional**. Nothing should exist "because it's default." If you can't explain why a color, font, spacing value, or animation exists — remove it.

Premium design is about **restraint and confidence**. It's knowing what to leave out. It's one perfect animation instead of twelve mediocre ones. It's breathing room instead of cramming.

---

## 2. TYPOGRAPHY — THE #1 THING THAT SEPARATES GOOD FROM GREAT

### DO

- Pick **one** distinctive display/heading font and **one** clean body font. Two fonts max.
- Use real, high-quality Google Fonts or self-hosted fonts. Great choices include:
  - **Display/Headings:** Playfair Display, DM Serif Display, Fraunces, Instrument Serif, Sora, Clash Display, Satoshi, General Sans, Cabinet Grotesk, Unbounded, Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope
  - **Body:** DM Sans, Source Serif 4, Libre Franklin, Work Sans, Karla, Nunito Sans, Figtree, Geist
- Use a **clear type scale** with consistent ratios (e.g., 1.25 or 1.333 modular scale)
- Headlines should be **large and confident** — don't be afraid of 48px–80px+ on desktop
- Set body text to **16px–18px** with **1.5–1.7 line-height** for readability
- Use `letter-spacing` intentionally: slight negative tracking on large headings (e.g., `-0.02em`), normal or slightly positive on small caps or labels
- Use `font-feature-settings` for OpenType features when available
- Limit line length to **60–75 characters** for comfortable reading (`max-width: 65ch`)

### ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

- Use Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, or Poppins — these scream "template" and "AI-generated"
- Use more than 2 font families
- Make all text the same size or weight — create clear visual hierarchy
- Use `font-weight: bold` on everything — be selective, bold loses meaning when overused
- Center-align long paragraphs of text
- Use tiny gray body text (the "startup landing page" cliché)

---

## 3. COLOR — LESS IS MORE, BUT MAKE IT COUNT

### DO

- Build a **tight, intentional palette**: 1 dominant neutral, 1 primary accent, 1 secondary accent max
- Use **CSS custom properties** for every color value — no hardcoded hex scattered around
- Use **near-black** instead of pure `#000000` (e.g., `#0a0a0a`, `#111111`, `#1a1a1a`)
- Use **near-white / warm white** instead of pure `#ffffff` (e.g., `#fafafa`, `#f5f4f0`, `#fefdfb`)
- Use accent color **sparingly** — it should draw the eye to ONE thing (a CTA, a key stat, a highlight)
- Consider the emotional temperature: warm neutrals (cream, sand, warm gray) feel premium; cool neutrals (blue-gray, slate) feel techy
- Use opacity and alpha channels for layering (`rgba`, `hsla`, or `oklch`)
- Test your palette in both light and dark contexts

### ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

- Use a rainbow of colors — premium = restrained palette
- Use saturated purple-to-blue gradients on white backgrounds (the single most common AI slop pattern)
- Use neon or overly saturated accent colors without purpose
- Put colored backgrounds on every section in alternating patterns
- Use pure black text on pure white backgrounds — it's too harsh, reduce contrast slightly
- Default to blue as the primary color just because "it's safe"

---

## 4. SPACING & LAYOUT — WHERE AMATEURS GET EXPOSED

### DO

- Use a **consistent spacing scale** based on a base unit (e.g., 4px or 8px): 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128
- Give sections **generous vertical padding** — 80px–160px on desktop. Let content breathe.
- Use **asymmetric layouts** when appropriate — not everything needs to be centered
- Use CSS Grid for complex layouts, Flexbox for simpler ones
- Max content width should be **1200px–1400px** for readability (narrower for text-heavy pages)
- Create visual rhythm through **consistent but not monotonous** spacing
- Use **negative space** as a design element — emptiness is premium
- Align elements to an invisible grid — even "organic" layouts should have underlying structure

### ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

- Use the same padding/margin value everywhere
- Cram elements together — if it feels tight, add more space
- Center everything on the page by default
- Use `margin: auto` as your only layout strategy
- Create symmetrical 3-column grids for everything (the "features section" cliché)
- Ignore mobile spacing — it needs its own considered scale, not just "smaller"

---

## 5. ANIMATION & MOTION — THE SECRET WEAPON (WHEN USED RIGHT)

### DO

- Use **one signature animation** on page load: a well-orchestrated staggered reveal is more impactful than 20 random animations
- Use `animation-delay` to stagger elements (e.g., 0ms, 80ms, 160ms, 240ms) for a choreographed feel
- Use subtle **hover transitions** on interactive elements (0.2s–0.3s ease-out)
- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only — these are GPU-accelerated and smooth
- Use **ease-out** for entrances, **ease-in** for exits, **ease-in-out** for state changes
- Use custom cubic-bezier curves for personality: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` feels snappy and premium
- Add scroll-triggered animations using `IntersectionObserver` — elements should animate in as they enter the viewport
- Add micro-interactions to buttons (slight scale, background slide, icon movement)
- Consider **reduced-motion** preferences: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`

### ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

- Animate everything at once — it creates visual noise, not delight
- Use bounce or elastic easing unless the brand is explicitly playful
- Use animation durations longer than 0.6s for UI elements (it feels sluggish)
- Use `transition: all` — always specify exact properties
- Add parallax scrolling just because you can — it's almost always distracting
- Make users wait for animations before they can interact
- Use `animate.css` or similar libraries — they look generic instantly
- Add floating particles, moving gradients, or "cursor trail" effects — these are AI slop hallmarks
- Use loading spinners or skeleton screens unnecessarily for static content

## 6. COMPONENTS & UI ELEMENTS

### Buttons
- **Primary buttons**: solid fill, generous padding (12px 28px minimum), subtle hover state (darken, slight lift, or background slide)
- **Secondary buttons**: outlined or ghost style, clearly secondary in visual weight
- Border radius: pick ONE value and stick with it site-wide (0px for sharp/editorial, 6-8px for modern, 999px for pill). Do NOT mix.
- Never make buttons too small — minimum 44px touch target height

### Cards
- Avoid heavy `box-shadow` — use subtle shadows or borders
- If using shadows, use **layered shadows** for depth: `box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`
- Give cards generous internal padding (24px–32px)
- Don't put a border, shadow, AND background color — pick one or two

### Images
- Always use `object-fit: cover` for contained images
- Use `aspect-ratio` for consistent image proportions
- Add subtle `border-radius` to images if the design language supports it
- Use `filter: grayscale()` or `mix-blend-mode` for editorial/premium image treatments
- Optimize images — use WebP/AVIF, lazy load below the fold

### Icons
- Use ONE icon set consistently (Lucide, Phosphor, or Heroicons are solid choices)
- Icons should be **subtle and supportive**, not the focal point
- Match icon stroke weight to your typography weight
- Don't use icons as decoration — every icon should communicate meaning

---

## 7. BACKGROUNDS & TEXTURE — CREATE DEPTH WITHOUT NOISE

### DO

- Use **subtle noise/grain textures** via CSS or SVG for a tactile, premium feel
- Use **soft, large-radius gradients** as backgrounds (not the neon AI kind — think subtle warm-to-cool shifts)
- Use `backdrop-filter: blur()` for glass/frosted effects (sparingly)
- Layer elements with slight opacity differences to create depth
- Consider a subtle dot grid, fine line pattern, or paper texture for editorial designs
- Use `mix-blend-mode` creatively for overlapping elements

### ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

- Use gradient mesh backgrounds with 5+ bright colors (peak AI slop)
- Add animated gradient blobs in the background
- Use stock pattern backgrounds
- Put a dark overlay on every hero image
- Use `background-attachment: fixed` (broken on mobile, looks dated)

---

## 8. RESPONSIVE DESIGN — NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT

### DO

- Design mobile-first in your mental model, even if coding desktop-first
- Use `clamp()` for fluid typography: `font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4.5rem)`
- Use `clamp()` for fluid spacing too
- Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, and 1920px
- Rethink layouts for mobile — don't just stack columns, reconsider hierarchy
- Make tap targets at least 44×44px on mobile
- Hide non-essential elements on mobile rather than squishing everything

### ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

- Just shrink the desktop version
- Use horizontal scroll on mobile (unless it's an intentional carousel)
- Forget to test on actual mobile devices / responsive mode
- Use fixed pixel widths for containers
- Leave text unreadable on small screens

---

## 9. DARK MODE (IF APPLICABLE)

### DO

- Use **elevated surfaces** instead of borders to show hierarchy (slightly lighter backgrounds for cards on dark backgrounds)
- Reduce white text opacity slightly for body text (`rgba(255,255,255,0.85)`)
- Use less saturated accent colors in dark mode
- Test contrast ratios — WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for body text)
- Use `#0a0a0a` or `#111` as base dark, not `#000000`

### ABSOLUTELY DO NOT

- Just invert the colors from light mode
- Use pure white text on pure black backgrounds
- Keep the same saturated colors from light mode
- Forget to adjust shadows (they're invisible on dark backgrounds — use lighter glows or borders instead)

## 10. THE "AI SLOP" CHECKLIST — AVOID ALL OF THESE

If your design has any of these, it looks AI-generated. Fix it immediately:

- [ ] Purple/blue gradient hero sections
- [ ] Inter, Roboto, or Poppins font
- [ ] Perfectly symmetrical 3-column feature grids with icons above text
- [ ] Generic stock illustrations or 3D blob characters
- [ ] "Get Started" / "Learn More" buttons with no visual hierarchy between them
- [ ] Overly rounded everything (border-radius: 20px on cards, buttons, inputs)
- [ ] Rainbow-colored gradients or excessive use of gradients
- [ ] Floating 3D objects or abstract shapes as decoration
- [ ] Every section having a different background color
- [ ] Excessive use of emoji in UI copy
- [ ] "Trusted by" logo bars with grayscale logos as the first thing you see
- [ ] Cards with thick colored borders and drop shadows simultaneously
- [ ] Animated gradient text (please stop)
- [ ] Hero section with headline, subtext, two buttons, and a phone mockup
- [ ] Cookie-cutter testimonial carousels with circular avatar images
- [ ] "Built with love" or "Made with ❤️" in the footer
- [ ] Using the same component library defaults without customization (shadcn default theme, etc.)
- [ ] Cursor-following effects or floating particles

## 11. WHAT PREMIUM ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE — REFERENCE THESE

Study these sites for inspiration on what premium web design actually feels like:

- **Stripe** — masterclass in clean layout, thoughtful animation, and color restraint
- **Linear** — dark mode done right, motion design, typographic confidence
- **Vercel** — minimal, fast, sharp typography
- **Apple** — scroll-driven storytelling, massive type, negative space
- **Rauno.me** — personal site that shows what's possible with attention to detail
- **Family.co** — editorial design for the web
- **Heyday** — warm, restrained, beautiful type
- **Aesop** — luxury retail done with restraint

## 12. FINAL RULES

1. **Every pixel is intentional.** If you didn't decide it, it shouldn't be there.
2. **Consistency is non-negotiable.** One border-radius. One spacing scale. One type scale. One animation curve.
3. **Whitespace is your best friend.** When in doubt, add more space.
4. **Less but better.** One great interaction > ten mediocre ones.
5. **No defaults.** If a value came from a framework or library default, question it and customize it.
6. **Test it ugly.** View your design with placeholder text, missing images, and edge cases. Premium design holds up under imperfect conditions.
7. **If it looks like every other AI-generated site, start over.**
